Parser : PVS code -> internal representation
Inverse transformation possible ?


Translation pvs -> ???
C : no lambda term...
better aim at functionnal languages... (ML, C++ ) rather than imperative
Clean : only expr ?


Translation  Coq/?? -> PVS

Need a Coq/?? parser
    (written/proved in PVS ? written in OCaml ? use Coq parser? )

Parsing Coq -> Translating Coq objects to PVS objects -> Generate PVS code
Parsing Coq -> Generate PVS code from Coq objects
Parsing Coq to PVS object -> Generate PVS code

Writing XML Parser (PVS ? Lisp ?)
Coq -> Parsed in OCaml to -> XML -> Parsed to PVS


Absence of mutable type...

Destructive functions
Lisp generated by PVS can't be runned efficiently (errors, non destructive functions, ...)


PVS -> Curry Howard isomorphism ?


What about Java ?
PVS to Java already exists  (use Why)
