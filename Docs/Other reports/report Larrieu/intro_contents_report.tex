In Section 3, we give more details about the ROS architecture and the model used to represent it. In Section 4, we prove low-level properties for the messaging system. In sections 5 to 7, we give assurance claims for simple end-to-end properties. Section 5 proves that a basic control loop maintains a state around a set value. Sections 6 and 7 give two different models for obstacle avoidance.
